# TrackMyLinks
App to Track all your Resources at a single place and makes management efficient.

====  This app is currently in developing phase ====

Many times, I find some cool stuff to read/refer later, but management of these resources is always cumbersome. So, I developed this app which consists of a REST API using Flask in back-end and powered by Angular JS in front-end.

There are more features, I'm currently working upon. If you've some suggestion, please let me know at Sanyam.Khurana@TheGeekyWay.com or alternatively just create an issue. I'll reach back to you ASAP.
